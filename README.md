# Codex Skills

A collection of Codex skills for reuse across projects.

## Repo layout

- Each skill lives in its own folder under `skills/`
- A skill folder must contain a `SKILL.md`

Current skills:

- `skills/plan`

## Install

Use the built-in skill installer to pull the skill directly from GitHub.

```bash
$skill-installer --repo YOUR_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG/codex-skills --path skills/plan
```

Restart Codex after installing to pick up the new skill.

## Adding more skills

Add a new folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`. Keep each skill self-contained.
